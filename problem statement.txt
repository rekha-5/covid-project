Problem Statement:

The increasing volume and complexity of COVID-19 data from diverse sources have resulted in significant challenges for effective analysis and decision-making. Inconsistent data formats, missing values, and varying levels of granularity hinder the ability to derive actionable insights. This research aims to develop a comprehensive data preprocessing framework that standardizes, cleans, and integrates COVID-19 datasets to enhance data quality and facilitate reliable epidemiological modeling and public health response strategies.
